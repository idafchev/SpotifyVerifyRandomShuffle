# SpotifyVerifyRandomShuffle
Basic python script to output a statistic about the songs played on shuffle.

Connects to spotify, gets the current song and adds it to a list with a counter.
When the script runs it waits for you to skip the current song manually, then when Enter is pressed, it gets the current song using Spotify API.
It keeps count how many times each song was played.
